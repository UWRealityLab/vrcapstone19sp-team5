# Week 1 - Main Ideas and Plans
### April 12th, 2019

This week we managed to come to a consensus on what we want our main project to be and did massive planning on basic interactions and ideas.

We've decided to focus on an Educational/Empathy based experience, where the user will go through the daily life of someone who is disabled, namely, in a wheelchair.

In doing so, we hope to create a sense of empathy for the disabled, and possibly inspire the user to create a more welcoming environment for the disabled, such as advocating ramps, etc., having experienced a small fraction of what life is like for them.

A key part of the experience will be rigging a chair, seen above, to be a wheelchair, where we'll attach the motion controllers to the sides of the wheel.

The user will constantly have to turn the wheels of the chair to be able to move around in the virtual environment, which helps add enormous authenticity to the experience. The chair will be elevated slightly to prevent it from actually moving when they turn the wheels, and straps will be attached from the wheels to their wrists to create the illusion of resistance (otherwise they'd be spinning the wheels in midair).
